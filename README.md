The simplex algorithm is the most famous for linear optimization. It is able to solve most linear problems in a polynomial time.   
This Scilab program takes into account :  
- Phase 1 simplex
- Degeneracy (cycling)  
   
It is therefore able to handle most cases. The program was tested on a problem including an initialization phase.
The problem includes 2 dimensions and therefore could be visualized in R². Geogebra was used to produce this visualization. The interactive Geogebra applet is available :
